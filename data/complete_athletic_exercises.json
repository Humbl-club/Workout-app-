      "exercise_name": "power_clean_from_floor",
      "scientific_explanation": "The power clean develops maximum power output through triple extension, with elite athletes generating >5000 watts. Garhammer's research shows optimal power development occurs at 70-80% 1RM. The exercise improves rate of force development by 18-25% and transfers directly to jumping and sprinting performance through similar movement patterns.",

      "exercise_name": "hang_clean_teaching_progression",
      "scientific_explanation": "The hang clean eliminates the technical demands of the first pull while maintaining the power development benefits.

      "scientific_explanation": "The depth jump exploits the stretch-shortening cycle to develop reactive strength index. Verkhoshansky's research establishes optimal drop heights of 0.3-0.8m based on individual strength levels. Ground contact times must remain <200ms to maintain plyometric stimulus. Studies show 25-35% improvements in vertical jump when performed correctly.",

      "scientific_explanation": "Medicine ball slams develop concentric power without eccentric braking, allowing for maximum velocity development. Research shows power outputs comparable to Olympic lifts when performed at optimal loads (10-15% body weight). The exercise trains the entire kinetic chain in an explosive pattern applicable to many sports.",

      "scientific_explanation": "Lateral bounds develop frontal plane power and stability essential for cutting sports.
