      "scientific_explanation": "The couch stretch targets the psoas major and rectus femoris in their lengthened position, addressing the most common restriction in modern athletes.

      "scientific_explanation": "The 90/90 position addresses both hip internal and external rotation simultaneously, targeting the deep hip rotators including piriformis and deep six.
