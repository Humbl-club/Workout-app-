# Advanced Density Training Program (High Volume & Core Focus)

This plan utilizes "Density Training"—minimizing rest by pairing main lifts with core work, mobility, or low-tax isolation exercises.

**Notation:**
*   A1/A2 denotes a Superset.
*   B1/B2/B3 denotes a Giant Set (perform consecutively, then rest).
*   RPE 8: 2 reps left in the tank.
*   RPE 9: 1 rep left in the tank.

## Daily "Non-Negotiables" (Mandatory Warm-up)

(10-15 minutes daily)

1.  **Spinal Health (The McGill Big 3):** 2 sets. Descending reps (5, 3, 1). 10s holds.
    *   McGill Curl-up
    *   Side Plank
    *   Bird-Dog
2.  **Thoracic (T-Spine) & Shoulder Mobility:**
    *   Foam Roller T-Spine Extensions (15 reps)
    *   Thread the Needle (Quadruped Rotation) (8 reps/side)
    *   Banded Pull-Aparts (2x20)
